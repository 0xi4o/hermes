# Hermes

Hermes is my implementation of a Redis-compatible key-value store.

I'm building it as a learning exercise alongside the [Redis Internals](https://arpitbhayani.me/redis-internals) course by [Arpit Bhayani](https://arpitbhayani.me/).

This project might also include some additional features or optimizations.
